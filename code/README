Instructions to download Ripple data
——————————————————
We provide the following scripts:
	* Ripple wallets (accounts): get_accounts_history_server.py
	* Ripple transactions: get_transactions_history_server.py
	* Ripple trust lines: get_trust_lines_history_server.py

Instructions to run the Heuristic1
------------------------------------------

1. Get the list of all Ripple accounts that have transacted with the 
DividendRippler account: rfYv1TXnwgDDK4WQNbFALykYuEBnrR4pDX. Store them 
in a file called accounts-attack.txt

2. Create a folder called account-pages and run the script script-get-account-pages.sh.
This would get the information about the account's info page for all the accounts

3. Create a folder called tx-per-account. 
Run the script script-get-tx-list.sh to get the list of all transactions done by every 
account. This scripts use the perl parser parser-dvdrippler-account.pl

4. Create a folder called tx-raw-info. 
Run the script script-get-specific-tx-info.sh to get the information about specific transactions
for all the considered currencies

5. Run the script script-get-issue-tx-linking.sh to link the accounts taking into 
account issuing transactions for the 4 currencies: btc, ltc, trc, nmc


5. Run the script script-get-redeem-tx-linking.sh to link the accounts taking into 
account issuing transactions for the 4 currencies: btc, ltc, trc, nmc
